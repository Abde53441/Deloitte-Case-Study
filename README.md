# Introduction and Problem Overview
# Airbnb is a internet marketplace for short-term home and apartment rentals. It allows you to, for example, rent out your home for a week while you’re away, or rent out your empty bedroom. Airbnb is a home-sharing platform that allows home-owners and renters (‘hosts’) to put their properties (‘listings’) online, so that guests can pay to stay in them. Airbnb pricing is important to get right, particularly in US where there is lots of competition and even small differences in prices can make a big difference. The aim of this project is to propose a data-driven solution, by using machine learning to predict rental price.
# Modeling approach and results
# Use Xgboost Machine Learning model for price prediction. XGBoost is likely to provide the best achievable accuracy using machine learning models (other than possible small accuracy increases from hyper-parameter tuning) due to its superior performance and general awesomeness as observed in Kaggle competitions. Because this is a regression task, The evaluation metrics used were mean squared error (for loss) and r-squared (for accuracy). With this model, the features explain approximately 69% of the variance in the target variable. Gradient Boosting Provide Estimate of feature importance from trained predictive model. The Top 10 most important feature are have been provided in the code
